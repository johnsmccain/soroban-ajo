Ajo – Onboarding Experience

This project showcases the onboarding flow I designed for Ajo, a community-based savings platform.

The goal was to create a simple, secure, and frictionless experience that guides users from introduction to wallet connection and profile setup.

✨ Overview

I worked on designing a 3-step onboarding flow:

Welcome Screen

Connect Wallet

Profile Setup

The experience focuses on clarity, trust, and minimal cognitive load.
