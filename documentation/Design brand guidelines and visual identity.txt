Ajo Finance: Community-Driven Savings
I worked on translating the core values of Ajo Finance into a cohesive digital experience. My focus was on building the future of Community Finance by creating a visual and verbal language that reflects trust, modernity, and a community-centric approach.

🎨 Design Philosophy & Visual Language
I worked on implementing a design system that balances technical sophistication with high readability.

Core Principles
Trusted: I prioritized creating a sense of reliability and security through consistent branding.

Modern: I utilized clean layouts and high-quality imagery to deliver a forward-thinking fintech experience.

Community-Focused: Every design choice I made supports the growth and financial stability of our users.

Typography & Imagery
Typography: I selected Space Grotesk as the primary typeface—using Bold for impact and Regular for body content—to balance a technical feel with accessibility.

Imagery Style: I curated an imagery style that combines global connectivity (abstract 3D visuals) with tangible, human-centered elements.

🛠 Features & Security
I worked on the essential modules that empower users to manage their savings securely.

Account & Wallet Management
Edit Profile: I streamlined the interface for managing personal details, bios, and contact information.

Wallet Management: I built a clear overview for linked cards and detailed transaction histories.

Notification Preferences: I implemented granular controls for push, email, and SMS alerts.

Security & Privacy (My Contribution)
Security was a primary focus for me. I worked on:

Multi-Factor Authentication: Integrated 2FA via SMS and Apps for enhanced security.

Biometric Login: Enabled FaceID and Fingerprint unlock for seamless, secure access.

Privacy Controls: I developed the "Profile Visibility" toggle and "Data Sharing" preferences to give users complete control over their digital footprint.

Activity Monitoring: I built the Account Activity Log to provide transparency on active sessions across devices and locations (e.g., Lagos, London, Abuja).
